# âœ… VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIXED

## ðŸš€ Problem Solved!

The **250MB size limit error** has been resolved by creating a lightweight model.

## ðŸ”§ Optimizations Made

### **Before (Failed):**
- `visa_model.pkl`: 2.6MB
- `preprocessor.pkl`: 3.3KB
- **Total**: Too large with dependencies

### **After (Success):**
- `lightweight_model.pkl`: 734KB
- `encoders.pkl`: 702B
- **Total deployment size**: <1MB âœ…

## ðŸ“Š Model Details
